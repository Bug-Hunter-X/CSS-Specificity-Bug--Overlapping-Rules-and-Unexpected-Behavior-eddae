The solution involves using the `!important` flag to explicitly give precedence to a specific rule. However, overuse of `!important` is generally discouraged because it can make the CSS harder to maintain.

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

#container {
  width: 600px !important;
}

<div id="container" class="container"></div>
```

Alternatively, resolving specificity issues by reorganizing selectors to ensure only the most specific rule applies without using `!important` is more efficient. Inspecting the browser's developer tools to pinpoint the source of conflicting styles is crucial for debugging.
