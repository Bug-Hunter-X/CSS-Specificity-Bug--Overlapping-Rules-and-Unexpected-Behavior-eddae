The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

#container {
  width: 600px;
}

<div id="container" class="container"></div>
```

The `#container` selector has higher specificity than `.container` so it should take precedence. However, the browser might apply both rules leading to unexpected behavior, or the `div` might be rendered larger than 600px.
